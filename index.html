              <h3><i class="far fa-question-circle"></i> What is Karate? </h3>
                Karate is a Japanese martial art. What is the word “Karate” origin? “Kara” means “empty,” and “te” means “hand.” 
                Together, the term “karate” refers to the art of fighting hand to hand without weapons.
                Karate techniques focus mainly on hand strikes, but uses elbow and knee strikes as well as some kicking techniques.

              <h3><i class="fab fa-leanpub"></i> What will I learn?</h3>
              
            Students practice two modalities of karate: kata, a series of attack and defense techniques used against an imaginary opponent, and kumite, sparring against an opponent using attack and defense techniques.

              <h3><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> What are the benefits?</h3>
              
            As a method of keeping fit and healthy, it develops balance, co-ordination, aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. In addition, (and unlike many other physical activities), it also challenges the brain and requires constant mental alertness and agility.
                Finally, the sporting element allows people of a sporting inclination to test their karate skills against others in a safe and controlled environment.

                    Miguel Diaz is the current champion of the all valley under 18 championships. Miguel quickly became the top student at the Cobra Kai Dojo, and is responsible for the influx of students that followed. 
                    Miguel's path under the leadership of Johnny took many turns, as he fell into the classic cobra kai mindset of "no mercy".
