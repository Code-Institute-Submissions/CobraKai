            About Cobra Kai
        </h2>
        <p>
            Karate is a Japanese martial art. What is the word “Karate” origin? “Kara” means “empty,” and “te” means “hand.” 
            Together, the term “karate” refers to the art of fighting hand to hand without weapons.
            Karate techniques focus mainly on hand strikes, but uses elbow and knee strikes as well as some kicking techniques.
        </p>
        <p>        
             Students practice two modalities of karate: kata, a series of attack and defense techniques used against an imaginary opponent, and kumite, sparring against an opponent using attack and defense techniques.
            The philosophy of karate emphasizes proper training of the mind as well as the body, building character, and focusing on principles such as respect, self-control, and concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            As a method of keeping fit and healthy, it develops balance, co-ordination, aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. In addition, (and unlike many other physical activities), it also challenges the brain and requires constant mental alertness and agility.
            Finally, the sporting element allows people of a sporting inclination to test their karate skills against others in a safe and controlled environment.
            The practice of karate is divided into three elements: kihon (basics), kata (forms) and kumite (sparring). However these three elements should not be considered separate, as they constantly overlap and rely on each other.
