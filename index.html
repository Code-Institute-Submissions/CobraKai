            As a method of keeping fit and healthy, it develops balance, co-ordination, aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility. In addition, (and unlike many other physical activities), it also challenges the brain and requires constant mental alertness and agility.
                Finally, the sporting element allows people of a sporting inclination to test their karate skills against others in a safe and controlled environment.

                    Miguel Diaz is the current champion of the all valley under 18 championships. Miguel quickly became the top student at the Cobra Kai Dojo, and is responsible for the influx of students that followed. 
                    Miguel's path under the leadership of Johnny took many turns, as he fell into the classic cobra kai mindset of "no mercy".
