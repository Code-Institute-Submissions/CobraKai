# Cobra Kai

 This project was designed to allow younger age groups to learn more about karate and hopefully sign up to lessons. This webpage will allow users to read about karate, Cobra Kai in particular, look at the gallery, see timetables for lessons and to sign up for classes if they wish.
As the developer i designed this project following watching the new Netflix TV series, Cobra Kai. I would like for younger kids to have a platform to learn more about Cobra Kai, view photos and hopefully come to learn!

## UX
The target audience for this project is aimed at teenagers. It will also include parents of these children who wish to sign up for karate.

As a new customer:
1. I want to read information on the type of karate learnt as this company
2. I want to see photographs to give me an idea of what to expect within the premises
3. I want to be able to see a timetable with classes and timetables
4. I want a form which is easy to use where i can sign up for lessons
5. I want to be able to return to the homepage quickly and easily
6. I need to have a contact telephone number and address
7. I want to visit the social media pages for various different platforms

As a returning customer I want:
1. To see the times and dates of upcoming classes
2. Updated photographs from recent classes and competitions
3. I need to have a contact telephone number

As a parent of customers I need:
1. To know the instructors are qualified and trustworthy
2. The premises are safe to carry out karate classes
3. To see the timetable of my childrens classes
4. To have an address and contact number 


As a developer I want:
1. Customers to be able to navigate through the website easily and quickly
2. Customers to feel comfortable enough to signup to karate after visiting the website
3. Consistency throughout all pages
4. A collage of photos in a gallery which encourage customers to sign up
5. A Navigation bar which will be simple for customers to follow and one which will stick to the screen

I hope this project will provide all users with 4 pages including a home page packed with information, a gallery page, timetable and a signup form.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiA9bmABhBbEiwASb35VwUP86nusbRkDn2_oK45Wc06sE-LKld8DUd5znTuQObwilsvALXI5RoCda0QAvD_BwE) for my project wireframes.
Below is a link to my wireframes for all three pages of my website. 

https://github.com/ShannonD7833/CobraKai/blob/master/assets/wireframes/CobraKai%20wireframes%20pdf.pdf

When building my web page I did make some changes which now differ to my wireframes. Using dev tools showed me better ways to present my project and so the final project may be different to the original wireframes designed.


## Features
* Logo of the company which when clicked will return the user to the index.html page
* Navigation bar which when hovered over will underline each page and will keep the page the user is on underlined
* Social media icons which when clicked will take the user to a new page and open up the social media page
* Consistent header and footers along each page of the webpage
* Photos and descriptions of instructors and current champion
* Interactive map with address and contact telephone number

## Technologies Used
* I used [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) languages for writing the code in this project.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used to style the font within my project. Lato font was used for the text.
* [Font awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) were used to add icons to the social media links in the footer.
* [Google maps](https://www.maps.ie/create-google-map/) was used for the iframe for the address map.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to make my website more responsive using layouts and tables to assist with my styling.


## Bugs Discovered

* Index.html
    * Images were square so i changed this to make it more visually appealing using chrome dev tools. [Without border radius](assets/images/border-radius.png) and then I added a border radius of 50% which is [here](assets/images/border-radius-after.png).

    * The margin between the social media links were too close together so using dev tools I played around with the padding size and found one that worked [here](assets/images/social-media-icons-after.png).

    * I used bootstrap to align my images in a much more user friendly way. I then checked this using dev tools to ensure the design was consistent at my breakpoints. [printscreen](assets/images/bootstrap-images.png)

* Signup.html

    * My submit button would not align into the center. I used dev tools to see if i could align it but I then had to align my parent DIV centrally and the button then aligned [here](assets/images/submitbutton.png)

    * Table would not work correctly on mobile view [here](assets/images/tablemobileview.png)







## Testing
* I tested my media queries and responsive design using the dev tools on chrome, as you can see the tablet view [here](assets/images/media-query-tablet-index.png) for the index page.

* I tested my media queries for the mobile view using dev tools which can be seen [here](assets/images/media-query-mobile-index.png)

* I had to make sure the navigation bar links were interactive and when clicked brought me to a different page and this can be shown [here](assets/images/test-navbar.png). The link under the navigation link became underlined and when clicked brought me to a the gallery page.

* When testing the social media icons, I clicked on them and they opened up the corresponding social media platform on a new page which is what I expected to happen so I knew that they worked.
