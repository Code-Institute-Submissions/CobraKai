# Cobra Kai

 This project was designed to allow younger age groups to learn more about karate and hopefully sign up to lessons. This webpage will allow users to read about karate, Cobra Kai in particular, look at the gallery, see timetables for lessons and to sign up for classes if they wish.
As the developer i designed this project following watching the new Netflix TV series, Cobra Kai. I would like for younger kids to have a platform to learn more about Cobra Kai, view photos and hopefully come to learn!

## UX
The target audience for this project is aimed at teenagers. It will also include parents of these children who wish to sign up for karate.

As a new customer:
1. I want to read information on the type of karate learnt as this company
2. I want to see photographs to give me an idea of what to expect within the premises
3. I want to be able to see a timetable with classes and timetables
4. I want a form which is easy to use where i can sign up for lessons
5. I want to be able to return to the homepage quickly and easily
6. I need to have a contact telephone number and address

As a returning customer I want:
1. To see the times and dates of upcoming classes
2. Updated photographs from recent classes and competitions
3. If i want to cancel my membership, I want to do this quickly and easily all online
4. I need to have a contact telephone number

As a parent of customers I need:
1. To know the instructors are qualified and trustworthy
2. The premises are safe to carry out karate classes
3. To see the timetable of my childrens classes
4. To have an address and contact number 


As a developer I want:
1. Customers to be able to navigate through the website easily and quickly
2. Customers to feel comfortable enough to signup to karate after visiting the website
3. Consistency throughout all pages
4. A collage of photos in a gallery which encourage customers to sign up
5. A Navigation bar which will be simple for customers to follow and one which will stick to the screen

I hope this project will provide all users with 3 pages including a home page packed with information, a gallery page and a page with a timetable including a signup form.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiA9bmABhBbEiwASb35VwUP86nusbRkDn2_oK45Wc06sE-LKld8DUd5znTuQObwilsvALXI5RoCda0QAvD_BwE) for my project wireframes.
Below is a link to my wireframes for all three pages of my website.

## Features
* Logo of the company which when clicked will return the user to the index.html page

* Social media icons which when clicked will take the user to a new page and open up the social media page
* Consistent header and footers along each page of the webpage

## Technologies Used
* I used [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) languages for writing the code in this project.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used to style the font within my project. Lato font was used for the text.
* [Font awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) were used to add icons to the social media links in the footer.


## Bugs Discovered

* Index.html
    * Images were square so i changed this to make it more visually appealing using chrome dev tools. [Without border radius](assets/images/border-radius.png) and then I added a border radius of 50% which is [here](assets/images/border-radius-after.png).

    * The margin between the social media links were too close together so using dev tools I played around with the padding size and found one that worked [here](assets/images/social-media-icons-after.png).
