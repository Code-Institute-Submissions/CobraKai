# Cobra Kai

 This project was designed to allow younger age groups to learn more about karate and hopefully sign up to lessons. This webpage will allow users to read about karate, Cobra Kai in particular, look at the gallery, see timetables for lessons and to sign up for classes if they wish.
As the developer i designed this project following watching the new Netflix TV series, Cobra Kai. I would like for younger kids to have a platform to learn more about Cobra Kai, view photos and hopefully come to learn!

## UX
The target audience for this project is kids aged from 6 years up to teenage years. It will also include parents of these children who wish to sign up for karate.
